# Deep-Learning

### 1. Case0

Goal: The goal was to find a simple neural network model using `Tensorflow neural network functions` 
and train it to classify the black and white handwritten digits in a small number of epochs.

Packages:
* Tensorflow


### 2. Case1

Goal: The goal was to learn to use neural networks to make an expert system to support in diagnostic decision making.
The objective was to read and pre-process the 'Heart Disease Health Indicator Dataset' from Kaggle and create and train
a dense neural network to predict to classify the presence of heart disease.

Packages:
* files, drive
* os
* pandas
* matplotlob
* sklearn (scikit-learn)
* seaborn
