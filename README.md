# Deep-Learning

### Case 1

Goal: The goal was to learn to use neural networks to make an expert system to support in diagnostic decision-making.
The objective was to read and pre-process the 'Heart Disease Health Indicator Dataset' from Kaggle and create and train
a dense neural network to predict to classify the presence of heart disease.

Packages:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn (scikit-learn)
* seaborn

### Case 2
Goal: The goal was to use convolutional neural network to create a binary classifier for x-ray chest images.
The aim was to achieve a minimum of 90% of sensitivity and 90% of specificity in classification results.

Packages:
* tensorflow
* sklearn (scikit learn)
* numpy
* matplotlib

### Case 3
Goal: The goal was to use the methods of text processing and to experiment with convolutional neural networks
to create a classifier for a collection of patient drug reviews extracted from Drugs.com.

Packages
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* tensorflow
* sklearn (scikit learn)
