# Deep-Learning

### Case 1

Goal: The goal was to learn to use neural networks to make an expert system to support in diagnostic decision making.
The objective was to read and pre-process the 'Heart Disease Health Indicator Dataset' from Kaggle and create and train
a dense neural network to predict to classify the presence of heart disease.

Packages:
* pandas
* matplotlob
* sklearn (scikit-l0earn)
* seaborn

### Case 2
Goal: The goal was to use convolutional neural network to create a binary classifier for x-ray chest images.
The aim was to achieve a minimum of 90% of sensitivity and 90% of specificity in classification results.

Packages:
* tensorflow
* scikit learn
* numpy
* matplotlib
